					<h2>1/23 Game Preview: Cavaliers at Celtics</h2>
					
					</header>
						
						All signs point to an easy Boston victory when the Celtics host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night.
					
						The Celtics have won four in a row overall and nine consecutive games at home. And Boston defeated Cleveland by 33 points on Nov. 30 -- the only time the teams have met this season.

						Cleveland (9-39) has the worst record in the league. The Cavaliers lost at home Monday by 16 points to Chicago, which has only 11 victories. Cleveland has lost nine of 10 games and continues to struggle with injuries in the post-LeBron James era.

						Kevin Love has played in only four games this season. Tristan Thompson has missed three straight games with a sore left foot that kept him out of 10 games earlier in the season. Larry Nance Jr. is out for at least another two weeks with a sprained MCL.

						Plus, before playing Chicago, Cleveland had just completed its longest West Coast trip of the season.

					<h2>Keys to the Game: Celtics 107, Heat 99</h2>
				
				</header>
					
					After answering pregame questions about the neighboring Patriots’ berth into the Super Bowl, the Boston Celtics stole a term from their friends’ sport: they blitzed the Miami Heat.

					Miami, a team that always plays the C’s tough, did so again during the first half of Monday’s matchup at the Garden. The teams were all evened up at 50-50 when they headed to the locker rooms for halftime.

					When the second half opened up, however, Boston was primed to blitz the Heat and put them on their heels.

					The Celtics scored the first nine points of the third period to get the ball rolling in their direction. They kept on rolling through the remainder of the period and built a 21-point advantage on the back of their starters.
